<!-- When working with containers, you usually need to create a Dockerfile to define your image and a compose.yaml file to define how to run it.

To help you create these files, Docker has a command called docker init. Run this command in a project folder, and Docker will create all the required files needed. In this guide, you will see how this works. -->
