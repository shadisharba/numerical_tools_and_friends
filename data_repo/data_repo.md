Storing data files in a GitHub repository is a common practice, especially for small to medium-sized datasets. However, for larger datasets or if you need more advanced data management capabilities, you might consider using a dedicated cloud storage service like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure Blob Storage. These services provide scalable and reliable storage options specifically designed for handling large amounts of data. Additionally, they offer features such as versioning, access control, and integration with other cloud services. Ultimately, the choice depends on your specific requirements and the size of your dataset.


Data Lakes and Databricks are also excellent options for storing and processing large datasets, especially when you need to perform complex analytics. A Data Lake is a storage repository that holds a vast amount of raw data in its native format until it is needed. It's excellent for storing unstructured or semi-structured data. AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure all offer Data Lake solutions.

Databricks is a unified data analytics platform. It's built around Apache Spark, an open-source distributed computing system, and provides a collaborative environment for data scientists and engineers to work together. Databricks can read data from various sources including Data Lakes and cloud storage services.

So, if your use case involves complex data processing or analytics, using a Data Lake with a service like Databricks could be a good choice. However, these services often come with a higher cost and complexity compared to simple cloud storage services, so it's important to consider your specific needs and resources.
