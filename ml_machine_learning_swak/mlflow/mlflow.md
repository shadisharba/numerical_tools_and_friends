# MLflow
MLflow is a platform to manage Machine Learning (ML) Lifecycle, which includes ETL, feature engineering, training, scoring, and monitoring model. MLflow can be integrated within the ML Lifecycle at any stage, depending on what users want to track.
Do note that there is a concept of experiment ID and experiment name, run ID and run name which cannot be mixed up!
